Dataset: Sales Analysis 

Cleaned and Analysed the data front to back, performed EDA in python notebook (not an avid user of python ://), 
facilitated a sketch for the dashboard first to visualise the final product in advance (would save time if preferences don't match),
finally created a dashboard consisting 4 pages - HomePage, Trend Analysis, Products & Warehouses, Geography & Customers.

Tools Used: Google Colab(Python), Power BI, Canva, Miro(for rough sketch of the dashboard)
